# InfraRed-Projects
A bunch of InfraRed projects i made using an old TV remote and an IR receiver. 
I learned how to use the remote to control a servo and later on made a very small IR controlled robot arm. 

This was my learning process so there might be a few errors.

Use the receiver file to decode the buttons on your remote.

Use the sensor to led to use the remote to activate and deactivate a few LED's with the remote.

Use The robot arm control to control 2 servos with the remote codes you get from the receiver file.
